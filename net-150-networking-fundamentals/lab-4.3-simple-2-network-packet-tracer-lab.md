# Lab 4.3: Simple 2-Network Packet Tracer Lab

In this lab, we connected 2 simple networks to a router and configured them for communication between end devices.

### Use of "Simulation Mode"

* Simulation Mode allows each step of the network communications processes to be viewed and executed individually (one at a time). Also captures packets and internet activity on observed networks, with the functionality of filtering/selecting which protocols you'd like to see.&#x20;

### How to save configurations on routers

* To save the configuration of a router in Packet Tracer, click the router, click 'config', 'settings', and then under the NVRAM field select 'save'. Packet Tracer Tips/Tricks
* Configure one network at a time if you can, just to ensure that connections are completed properly and that each section of the network works well.
* Document what connections are made to what interfaces
