# Lab 4.1: Observing ARP in Packet Tracer

* In network switch CLI tab, you can type "enable" to enable root mode.

This lab was focused around setting up 4 PCs, a switch, connecting them all, and ensuring the connections made function properly. This is done by connecting all PCs through ethernet to the switch, configuring the static IPv4 IPs and netmasks properly, and pinging the systems through the command prompt of a PC in the network.
