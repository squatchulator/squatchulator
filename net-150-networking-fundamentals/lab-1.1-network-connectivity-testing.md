# Lab 1.1: Network Connectivity Testing

In this lab, we tested the functionalities of several command line tools such as:

* ipconfig
* ipconfig /all
* ping
* tracert
* nslookup

This lab was also intended to introduce us to the information displayed by ipconfig and ipconfig /all such as MAC addresses, IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. One issue I ran into that halted progress for a while surrounded not being able to find the Kali Linux VM ISO file on the X: drive, as I was trying to access it from my home network using the cyber.local VMs. This will not work due to the fact that the PCs on the school's network are operating on a VPN and these drives must be accessed in person.
