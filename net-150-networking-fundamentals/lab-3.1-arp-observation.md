# Lab 3.1: ARP Observation

To clear the cache on Linux

* sudo ip -s -s neigh flush all

The purpose of this lab is to begin capturing ARP requests in Wireshark and what the information on ARP packets means. This includes source and destination MAC addresses, protocols, and requests/replies. The ARP request and response are the two yellow packets that appear at the beginning of a ping capture.
