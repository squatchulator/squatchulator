# Lab 2.1: Intro to Packet Tracer and Deploying/Pinging Devices

Packet tracer allows you to simulate a network in a GUI environment. Ensure version of Packet Tracer is 8.1.1 or lower.

In this lab, we set up a Cisco Network Academy account and explored how to cable/deploy devices in a Packet Tracer virtual network.&#x20;

### How do you deploy workstations and switches in Packet Tracer?

* Switches and workstations can be deployed in Packet Tracer by selecting the "Network Devices" or "End Devices" respectively. In the options below these, you may choose if you want hubs, switches, routers, etc. There are similar varieties of options for the "End Devices" as well. Select the specific device you want, and drag it onto the screen where you want in order to deploy the device.&#x20;

### How do you connect these devices with cables?

* Devices can be connected with cables by selecting the "Connections" option at the bottom of the screen (the lightning bolt icon) and determining what sort of connection you want via the options displayed at the bottom of the screen. You select the cable you want, and then click on a PC. A list of options will appear, and once one is selected you may choose the other connection point for the cable. A similar list of options will appear and when selected, the connection will be made (it may take a second for both light indicators to turn green).&#x20;

### How do you access the command-line terminal on a Packet Tracer PC?

* In Packet Tracer, you can click on the PC and a window will appear. At the top of the window, you can click the 'Desktop' tab, and a screen with many options will appear, but there should be one near the top labeled "Command Prompt" and this is where you may access a command-line terminal for that PC.
