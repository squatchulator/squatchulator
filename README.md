### About me:

I'm a Computer Networking and Cybersecurity student going into my senior year at Champlain College. I've gained experience in scripting, network configuration and management, network and physical security, and automation.

I'm working part-time as a security engineer at a cybersecurity firm run by my college that offers security and IT support to clients across the state of Vermont, and I particularly enjoy defensive security and learning about detection technologies.

Outside of school & work, I love to watch hockey and baseball, play games with friends, model & paint miniatures, and explore Vermont when its warm out.
