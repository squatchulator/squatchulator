### About me:

I'm a Computer Networking and Cybersecurity student going into my senior year at Champlain College. I've gained experience in scripting, network configuration and management, network and physical security, and automation.

I'm working part-time at a cybersecurity firm run by my college that offers security and IT support to clients across the state of Vermont, and have found that I thoroughly enjoy the process of finding solutions to technology problems and working face-to-face with clients during that process. I particularly enjoy working with the backend of security software and SIEM maintinence. 

Outside of school & work, I love to watch hockey and baseball, play games with friends, model & paint miniatures, and explore Vermont when its warm out.
